# Website Builder

Website builder is a simply app which makes a copy of each file in the `src` folder and puts it in `build`, while ignoring any folder or file specified in the `ignore_list.jemignore` file. Also ignores Markdown files so your docs are kept private!

### How to use

Simply run the `run.bat` script, this will open your terminal execuing the script using Python.

Alternatively, you can simply run the command
```bash
py app.py
```

You will then see all the files being ignored and the reason why.

### What I learned

- I learnt how to handle files and folders in Python with more efficiency.
- I have also learned how to scan a folder thoroughly.
- These new skills I have gained will help my in future projects.
